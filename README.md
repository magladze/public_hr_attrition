# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains analysis of the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset through two different approaches. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of employee performance and attrition, allowing for in-depth analysis and insights into various factors influencing employee turnover.

The analysis is conducted using two Jupyter Notebooks:
1. Standard Analysis Methods: `ibm_attrition_dataset_analysis_standard.ipynb`
2. Artificial Neural Networks: `ibm_attrition_dataset_analysis_artificial_neural_networks.ipynb`

## Dataset Background

The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of Human Resources (HR) analytics. It includes various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition status. The dataset has been widely used for exploring the factors that contribute to employee attrition and for developing predictive models to identify employees who are likely to leave the organization.

### Dataset Attributes

The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- EmployeeID: Unique identifier for each employee.
- Age: Age of the employee.
- Attrition: Whether the employee has left the company (Yes/No).
- BusinessTravel: Frequency of business travel.
- Department: Department in which the employee works.
- DistanceFromHome: Distance of the employee's home from the workplace.
- Education: Education level of the employee.
- JobRole: Role of the employee within the company.
- JobSatisfaction: Job satisfaction level of the employee.
- MonthlyIncome: Monthly income of the employee.
- PerformanceRating: Performance rating of the employee.
- YearsAtCompany: Number of years the employee has been with the company.

## Analysis Methods

### Standard Analysis Methods

The first notebook, `ibm_attrition_dataset_analysis_standard.ipynb`, utilizes traditional data analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary libraries used include:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

These methods are effective for exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and building initial predictive models. Techniques such as decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVM) are commonly employed.

### Artificial Neural Networks

The second notebook, `ibm_attrition_dataset_analysis_artificial_neural_networks.ipynb`, employs artificial neural networks (ANNs) for analysis. ANNs are a subset of deep learning models inspired by the human brain's neural networks. The primary libraries used include:

- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training neural network models.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

ANNs are particularly powerful for capturing complex patterns and relationships within the data. They are well-suited for tasks involving large datasets and non-linear relationships.

## Technical Comparison

### Standard Analysis Methods

Standard analysis methods, such as those provided by Scikit-learn, are highly interpretable and relatively quick to implement. They are suitable for initial data exploration and when the dataset is not overly complex. For example, logistic regression provides clear coefficients that indicate the impact of each feature on the likelihood of attrition.

Advantages:
- High interpretability.
- Faster training and evaluation times.
- Easier to implement and understand.

Disadvantages:
- May struggle with capturing non-linear relationships.
- Performance may be limited on complex datasets.

### Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks are more flexible and can model complex, non-linear relationships in the data. They are particularly useful when the dataset is large and intricate patterns need to be captured. For instance, ANNs can uncover deep insights into how various factors interact to influence employee attrition.

Advantages:
- Capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships.
- Can handle large and high-dimensional datasets.
- Often achieve higher predictive accuracy.

Disadvantages:
- Require more computational resources.
- Longer training times.
- Less interpretable compared to traditional methods.

## Use Case Examples

### When to Use Standard Methods

- Exploratory Data Analysis: When you need to quickly understand the dataset and identify key trends.
- Interpretability: When the model's interpretability is crucial for business decisions, such as understanding the impact of different factors on attrition.
- Resource Constraints: When computational resources are limited, and you need a fast and efficient solution.

### When to Use Artificial Neural Networks

- Complex Patterns: When the dataset involves complex and non-linear relationships that standard methods cannot capture effectively.
- Large Datasets: When working with large datasets where ANNs can leverage their capacity to learn from vast amounts of data.
- High Predictive Accuracy: When the primary goal is to achieve the highest possible predictive accuracy, and interpretability is less critical.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset using both standard analysis methods and artificial neural networks. Each approach has its strengths and is suitable for different scenarios. By understanding the differences between these methods, you can choose the most appropriate technique for your specific use case and gain valuable insights into employee attrition and performance.
